# Weather-Now
## This is my very first android app and I've developed it with "React Native"

The app can be used to track the present condition of weather according the device location. Current temperature can be checked in three different units ( C, F, K ) with this app. Also **6** more information can be tracked from this application. And that is,
1. Time of sunrise1.
2. Time of sunset
3. Temperature feels like right now
4. Current humidity
5. Current wind speed &
6. Current Pressure
